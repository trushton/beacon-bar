Styles
=========

"bootstrap-grid.css" contains styles to manage the grid layout. Read up on [bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid)

"common.css" contains core styles including layout, headers, footers, and other shared components

> Note: consider implementing a flex-based header-footer layout for the instead of the static sizes for `body`, `.bar-header`, and `.bar-footer` elements.
It will hurt scroll performance but you won't have to worry about constantly updating heights of each element between pages.

Layout
=========

"inrangedevices.html" contains the basic template. simply modify the contents of `main` element on each page and `header`, if necessary.


JS Templating
==========

Using handlebars JS for super basic templating. An example can be found in 'newaer-inrangedevices.js'. Read more on using handlebars [here](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
